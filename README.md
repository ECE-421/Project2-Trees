# ECE421 - Project 2 - Red Black and AVL trees

The project focuses on the implementation of AVL and Red-Black tree data structures, and includes some rudimentary benchmarking of their relative performance.

## Project questions

### Q1 - What does a red-black tree provide that cannot be accomplished with a regular binary tree?

A red-black tree provides the ability to be self balanced, which is not accomplished by a regular binary tree. This allows them to guaruntee a maximum height and effectively guaruntees their search time to be O(log n).

### Q3 - Do you need to apply any kind of error handling in your system? (e.g. panic macro, Option\<T>, Result\<T> etc..)

### Q4 - What components do the red-black tree and the AVL tree have in common? Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY) - fundamental programming idea

### Q5 - How do we construct our design to allow it to tbe 'efficiently and effectively extended'? For example, could the code be used in a 2-3-4 tree or B tree?
